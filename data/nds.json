Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called \"The Guardians\", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.\n\nMega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.\n\nAs players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of \"biometal\", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.",

There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they \"ignite\" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into \"orbit\" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different \"planets\" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.",

The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.\n\nThere are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.\n\nPicross DS has a variety of different modes:\n\n1.  Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.\n\n2.  Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.\n\n3.  My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.\n\n4.  Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\n\nYou can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.",

As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen.  Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.  Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen.  Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles.  The selection of puzzles is quite varied.  If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'.  However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.\n\nProfessor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting.  While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes.  The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.",

    "synopsis": "At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.\n\nGraphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.\n\nStandard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard \"get 25 lines to win\" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.\n\nPush mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.\n\nTouch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.\n\nPuzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.\n\nMission mode gives you specific goals like \"Use a square block to clear a line\" or \"Clear 3 lines with an L piece\".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.\n\nCatch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.\n\nMultiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.",

    "synopsis": "The World Ends With You is an action-RPG that puts players in the role of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen, loner of a teenager who wakes up to find himself in modern day Shibuya, Japan, with no memory of how he got there and a ticking clock in his hand that tells him to complete the mission... or face erasure.\n\nNeku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as \"Players\" in a game that lasts seven days.  Each day, players are given various missions to perform by the \"Reapers\" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.\n\nPlayers use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against \"The Noise\", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone.  Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.  \n\nPlayers can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.\n\nThere is also a wi-fi mini-game called \"Ten Pin Slammer\", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.",
